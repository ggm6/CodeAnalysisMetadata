Score: 75

## Files & Changed Files
* Only required files committed
* Proper files changed

## Build
* Successfully builds, no errors, no warnings

## Test
* Passes all user tests
* Lots of extraneous output. In testing, we don't confirm/check, we let the code do it. Would understand if based on test name/etc, but this just appears random.
* Why are you mentioning me? I don't mention myself in the code. This is code that could be worked on by multiple people.

## Test Oracle: code\_analysis\_t.cpp
* Fails a few tests in the oracle test suite with student's implementation

## Test Oracle: code\_analysis.cpp
* Fails an early test in the student's test suite with oracle implementation

## Code
* Necessary code is present
* Good indentation
* Pretty good statement structure
* Separate your if statements with blank lines. Each is for a different case
* If you have an if-then-else and return in both the then and the else, return at end of function is not necessary, and is confusing in ```analysis_language()```

## Test Cases
* This is not a set of test cases, but one long test. We covered how to do this in class. 
* You did not add any asserts to check, but did so manually. That is not proper unit testing.

## Literal Values used in Testing
* Lots of garbage here due to lack of unit tests

## Error Messages
* Proper error messages
* Messages written to proper output

## Commits
* Why not delete all the garbage code in one commit?
* I believe your history may not be showing right in the report. However, viewing on GItHub, it is clear that TDD was not followed.
